          <p> Fruitful Durham Social Enterprise (CIC) is based in a village called Bearpark just a couple of miles outside of Durham city, North East England.  We collect surplus fruit and make pure Durham apple juice, fruit cordials, jams, jellies, chutneys and pickles. Local shops stock our products and we occasionally have stalls at local markets and events.  For those who would like to enjoy the juice made from their own apples we run a juicing service which can include personalised labels.
We also offer productive gardening services: from garden design, fruit tree pruning and garden maintenance.  We are currently turning the land at the back of a doctor&#39;s surgery into a productive garden for patients and staff to enjoy.
We run activities and workshops to all ages on all things fruitful including fruit tree planting, fruit foraging, apple picking, cooking with fruit, pressing apples into juice, grafting and pruning. From WI meetings to school classes and assemblies we do presentations and workshops and demonstrate traditional fruit juice production.
To increase the abundance of fruit trees locally, we also graft and raise local varieties which will be available from the autumn.
We love organising community celebrations and festivals, including Blossom/May Day, Apple Day (October) and wassailing (January).
If anyone near to Durham city has unwanted fruit or veg. or would like to volunteer - please do get in touch.

          <p>Orchard Mawr is a community project led by a voluntary group under the umbrella of Transition Haverfordwest.
We aim to plant a dispersed orchard of a thousand fruit and nut trees by the end of the decade, creating a wild harvest on plots of publicly accessible land in Haverfordwest and surrounding villages in Pembrokeshire.
It’s a big challenge we know but, with the support and determination from our growing network of members, we are optimistic that we will achieve this by 2020.

          <h2 class="title is-4">Stratford Harvest Share</h2>
          <p>Stratford Harvest Share collects unwanted fruit in and around Stratford upon Avon. We started in 2010 in a small way, but were then offered the orchard at Anne Hathway&#39;s Cottage - one of the historic Shakespeare properties in Stratford - so we&#39;ve been operating on a larger scale since 2011, when we picked nearly 3.5 tonnes of fruit.
Free boxes of fruit are distributed weekly to local care homes and children&#39;s groups, with any surplus being processed. In 2013, most of the processing was into apple juice - we had over 800 large bottles, all of which sold by Christmas. We have also started winter maintenance at Anne Hathaway&#39;s Cottage and planted some new trees there. The autumn usually finds us at various apple days and fairs, demonstrating juicing using a small hand press.
Stratford Harvest Share is one of a number of initiatives started and run by Transition Stratford, the Transition Town for Stratford upon Avon and the surrounding area.

          <h2 class="title is-4">Willesden Fruit Harvesters</h2>
          <p>We pick fruit in Willesden and Dollis Hill in north west London and distribute the surplus to local community groups. These include food banks, homeless shelters, charities and schools.

The group started in summer 2012, following a public meeting and screening of an award-winning video by group member and local photographer Jon Goldberg.

In our first season we carried out a small number of picks yielding 300 kg of fruit. In 2013 we picked nearly 600 kg, and this year it was around half that, due to unseasonably warm weather.

We took part in a big pick with Kensal to Kilburn Harvesters and Mapesbury Residents&#39; Harvesters and together we have now bought a 12 litre fruit press.

For more on what we did with all the apples, pears, plums and grapes this year and how they were appreciated by local community groups see here.

We&#39;ve also joined Twitter @WHarvesters and Face book Willesden Harvesters and updated our publicity here.
We&#39;re always looking for more people to help us pick and for more trees to harvest. To join us please email willesdenharvesters@gmail.com.

          <p>Based in Reading, we&#39;ve been running since around 2010. We harvest apples and pears from local trees (either on public land, or in gardens by request). And provide apples for events like the Reading Town Meal. Surplus fruit (and any vegetables) are donated to a local drop-in centre for the needy and community cafés.
We&#39;re a project of Transition Town Reading, and have a community apple crusher and press which are available for community groups and events.
Transition Town Reading are involved in planting orchards on public land around Reading, and we help to tend those orchards.

          <p>Abundance Kingston aims to harvest the seasonal glut of local fruit, such as apples, pears and plums and redistribute the surplus to the Kingston community (local nurseries, homeless shelters, individuals) on a non-profit basis. Private owners will of course always get the first share, and some fruit will be left for the birds, bees and insects (!), with bruised and damaged fruit being juiced, so no fruit goes to waste.
We aim to:
- Provide fresh fruit to local people who otherwise would not have access to it
- Reduce food waste in the borough by harvesting fruit that would otherwise be left to rot- Train people in how to preserve fruit through jam, chutney, and juice-making workshops- Contribute to reducing Kingston’s carbon footprint by making use of local food and encouraging more local growing, cultivation and harvesting- Educate people about the value of fruit trees in terms of human health, nutrition and ecology- Map fruit trees and other sources of wild food across the borough, noting location, variety, yield and accessibility

          <h2 class="title is-4">Abundance Oxford</h2>
          <p>Hello!
We&#39;ve interpreted &quot;Abundance&quot; as a project that celebrates abundance through-out the seasons, and before/after harvest time we plan on inspiring, skill-sharing and keeping the project sustainable even as it grows. So we will be running pruning and grafting skill-shares and building our own bicycle trailers to transport fruit and veg around much more easily!
Harvest season is our busiest time, and in our first harvest year (2012) we mainly harvested apples and redistributed them to charities and organisations such as Donnington Doorstep (supporting children from low-income families) and Steppin&#39; Stones (supporting the homeless through a social enterprise and café) that used them in cooking hot meals as well as in activities. We also took apples to community events, to the streets, to the One World Fair, to Harvest festivals throughout Oxford, Apple Days and even held our own Apple Day.
We also go foraging together, skill-sharing and always making sure we only take from areas where there is an ABUNDANCE and where we aren&#39;t making a significant impact on the environment. We&#39;ve made nettle soup, elderflower cordial, wild green pesto and wild green filled pies, elderberry jam, hedgerow jelly, crab apple &amp; wildings jelly, crab apple &amp; rosehip jelly, sloe gin &amp; more from nature&#39;s larder as well as much more from cultivated unwanted fruits such as apples, pears, quinces, medlars, unripe figs and beyond...
Whether you&#39;ve just moved to Oxford, have been living there a while or are passing through and would like to find out more about what we get up to as Abundance Oxford please :
Check out our blog: http://abundanceoxford.wordpress.com/
Join our Facebook group: www.facebook.com/groups/abundanceoxford
or better still, email us on: abundanceharvestsoxford@gmail.com &amp; we&#39;ll be happy to answer your questions, give you a quick update on what you can join in on and what we need help on.

We&#39;re a friendly bunch so please get in touch and come join in to whatever aspect you fancy:
-  running workshops on any fruity/veg preserving, or foraging and skill-shares
- cycling round the city scouting for trees and flyering or chatting to the owners
- making and distributing eye-catching flyers
- making contact with those we can collect fruit from and helping organise harvests
- making contact with those we can redistribute fruit to and helping organise collections
- offering free kitchen space for cooking, offering free meeting-room space, offering implements that could help us in harvest, redistribution and preservation
- pruning trees, grafting trees, planting trees and sharing the skills to do so
&amp; most of all, sharing food together that would have otherwise gone to waste and spreading the word!

We welcome new people, new ideas, new side-projects and new contacts and organisations that we can work with- whether they can provide us with excess or are in need of produce. We look forward to hearing from you!
Abundant love

          <h2 class="title is-4">Abundance Glasgow</h2>
          <p>The group made up of volunteers from various different areas in the city is in its infancy.
We are discovering the joys of urban fruit harvesting. Mainly having a harvest and a workshop each weekend.
Looking to get more and more fruit so we can share it around.
Based at Locavore (the local food hub in the Southside of Glasgow www.glasgowlocavore.org).
We also have some new toys to help us along the way: a press+crusher, fruit pickers, dehydrator (for some tasty apple crisps) and more.

          <h2 class="title is-4">Abundance London (Chiswick)</h2>
          <p> Abundance London in Chiswick - like all the other groups - helps to deal with gluts and harvest surplus fruit. We work closely with local schools, leading picking groups of kids&#39; to learn about and enjoy fruit picking, as well as general volunteer sessions. We run occasional grafting and pruning workshops. We also run occasional planting projects, such as the Edible Playground (December 2011), and the Edible High Road (at Chelsea Fringe 2012). Please contact us if you would like to be involved in any way.

          <p>
We pick fruit from local back gardens - apples, pears, plums etc and give it away to schools and community groups, make juice, jam or just eat it. All to save fruit from rotting on the ground and to build community. We&#39;ve picked 1.5 tons a year and make juice, jam and chutney.  We have over 250 people on our mailing list, and have picked with local residents and disability groups. We’ve trained 40 people to prune, lend out a fruit picking tool through a local library and have planted 40 fruit trees on a local estate.

          <h2 class="title is-4">Abundance Wimbledon</h2>
          <p> Abundance Wimbledon is about using up fruit that would otherwise go to waste.
Lots of people think it would be good to use up all the fruit growing on trees and bushes around Wimbledon, but nobody can do this on their own. By bringing people together in this project, we have been able to pick some of this surplus fruit, eat it and make it into a wonderful range of jams, chutneys, cakes and sweets, and pass nearly half a tonne on to people who are struggling to find enough money to eat healthily. People from different backgrounds have worked together, shared their skills, appreciated nature and being in the open air, and enjoyed the whole experience. Individuals have come from across Wimbledon and beyond, older people have got involved in fruit picking and jam-making, and children have joined in enthusiastically too.

          <h2 class="title is-4">WEN Abundance</h2>
          <p>WEN Abundance was set up in 2007 and is part West Ealing Neighbours, a local residents group.   We have around 40 volunteers and pick from private back gardens as well as green open spaces in the West Ealing/Ealing and Hanwell area. The fruit is put to good use by:

Giving away to the local soup kitchen
Free fruit box distribution scheme
Making jams, chutneys, juice and cordials to sell at local fairs - all monies are ploughed back into the project to buy equipment
Work with local social enterprises/housing associations on related projects
We also have a small Orchard in W13 that we are currently renovating with help from The London Orchard Project

WEN Abundance works on a purely voluntary basis and we always welcome volunteers, even if they can only help occasionally.
