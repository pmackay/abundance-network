      <p class="is-size-5 has-margin-top-4">We pick fruit in Willesden and Dollis Hill in north west London and distribute the surplus to local community groups. These include food banks, homeless shelters, charities and schools.

The group started in summer 2012, following a public meeting and screening of an award-winning video by group member and local photographer Jon Goldberg.

In our first season we carried out a small number of picks yielding 300 kg of fruit. In 2013 we picked nearly 600 kg, and this year it was around half that, due to unseasonably warm weather.

We took part in a big pick with Kensal to Kilburn Harvesters and Mapesbury Residents&#39; Harvesters and together we have now bought a 12 litre fruit press.

For more on what we did with all the apples, pears, plums and grapes this year and how they were appreciated by local community groups see here.

We&#39;ve also joined Twitter @WHarvesters and Face book Willesden Harvesters and updated our publicity here.
We&#39;re always looking for more people to help us pick and for more trees to harvest. To join us please email willesdenharvesters@gmail.com.
