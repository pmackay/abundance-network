# Hints and Tips

Here are a few hints and tips noted by the Abundance community:

## Mapping

The aim of Abundance is to look at surpluses, so it may not be worth mapping any fruit tree you see. Just focus on the ones that are productive and have a surplus that is not used.

## Private gardens

Its much easier to choose gardens that have a side gate or other access from the street, rather than having to walk a group of potential strangers through someone's house.

## Distribution

Think about where the fruit is going after picking, so it doesn't spoil.

The best time to pick for an event is a few days beforehand, so fruit that might be bruised is not being stored for days in boxes, increasing its chance of going rotten.
